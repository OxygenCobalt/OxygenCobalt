Hi. I'm Alex, but I prefer to go by my handle OxygenCobalt. I'm a programmer from Colorado that enjoys android development and systems programming.

#### What I'm working on

- [**Auxio**](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Auxio): An android music player I primarly made for myself. Designed to be
fast and functional without the useless features of other music players.

- **lockbox:** An in-progress KeePass-compatible password manager.

- [**musikr**](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/musikr): An audio tagger that I lost interest in, but am trying to revive again.

#### What I've done

- A few games:
  - [**monoman**](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/monoman) (Puzzle-Platformer)
  - [**FXChess**](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/FXChess) (Chess)
  - [**Sweepered**](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Sweepered) (Minesweeper Clone)
- A bunch of [other old/small projects](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Project-Archive) over the years.
- Thats about it. I don't really work on small finite projects.

#### What I want to do

- More systems/embedded programming
- More command line utilities/curses programs
- More android-related utilities and android apps

#### Other info

- Messaging: Use E-Mail. I do not like Discord or Telegram.   
- Social Media: Is an psychologically unhealthy vice.
- PGP Key (Have one, working on making a public key)
