Hi. I'm Alex, but I prefer to go by my handle OxygenCobalt.
I'm a programmer from Colorado that enjoys android development and systems programming.

#### What I'm working on

[**Auxio**](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Auxio): An android music player I primarly made for myself. Designed to be
fast and functional without the useless features of other music players.

[**musikr**](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/musikr): A WIP command-line music metadata tagger and tagging library.
Currently on the backburner as I focus on Auxio.

#### What I've done

[**Sweepered**](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Sweepered): Minesweeper clone I created with Java/JavaFX as a learning project

[**FXChess**](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/FXChess): Chess game I created with Java/JavaFX as a learning project

I've also created a number of [Other Projects](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Project-Archive) over the years.

#### What I want to do

- More systems/embedded programming
- More command line utilities/curses programs
- More android-related utilities and android apps
